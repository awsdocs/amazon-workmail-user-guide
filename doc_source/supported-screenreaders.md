# Supported Screen Readers<a name="supported-screenreaders"></a>

You can use the following browser\-based screen readers with Amazon WorkMail:
+ Firefox—NVDA
+ Internet Explorer—JAWS
+ Safari—VoiceOver

**Note**  
For **NVDA/JAWS** some actions work best when you enter or exit **Forms** mode\.

Most of the commands provided can be used across all screen readers\. Some screen readers, such as VoiceOver, offer keyboard\-based combinations for voiceover controls\. For example, in VoiceOver use **VO\+Right** arrow in place of the right\-arrow key on your keyboard\.

**Note**  
The following exceptions apply only to VoiceOver:   
**VO\+Spacebar** replaces **Enter**\.
**VO\+Left/Right** arrows replace **Tab** and **Shift\+Tab**\.
**Fn\+Delete** replaces **Delete**\.

For best accessibility, use plain text as the email format and disable the **Preview** pane\. For information, see the *Email settings* section in [Working with General and Email Settings](general-settings.md)\.
